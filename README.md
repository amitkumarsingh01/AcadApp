The subject cards can be modified or deleted as needed, providing users with a convenient way to organize their academic data.

4. **Firebase Integration**: The app is integrated with Firebase to securely store subject data anonymously. Users can store their subject information on the cloud, ensuring data persistence and accessibility across devices.
